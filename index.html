											<p class="bigger">During the Mdef Bootcamp, we had to think, understand and acknowledge what we want to learn during our intense 9 months at Mdef. What is my fight? A fight according to the Cambridge Dictionary stands for “ is to use a lot of effort to defeat or achieve something, or to stop something happening:” Therefore to understand what my fight was I needed to see what I would like to put my energy and effort towards.</p>
											<p>Coming from a spatial design background - a densely populated island - always allowed myself to view the island relations to the destruction or control money and investment as in the changes in our surrounding environment.</p>
											<p>I saw the changes of consumerist culture throughout my childhood and today I ask the same questions of the lack of care and time being put into the materials we use, discard and create with Growing up on a small island that has a lot of potential I have found myself wondering how greed and money controlled our environment. I grew up from having my essentials out of glass bottles where at the end of the week we took them outside our doorstep to be collected and reused. To transform into having everything transported in plastic. At a young age, I asked myself and my elders why this was happening and why they didn’t seem to care that much.</p>
											<p>Here I am somewhat 15 years later asking myself the same question.</p>
											<div class="quotebox">
												<div class="icon">
													<img class="svg" src="img/svg/quote.svg" alt="" />
												</div>
												<p>“Only one per cent of Malta’s plastic waste was recycled in 2019, with most ending up dumped in landfill, according to a new report published by the National Audit Office. The NAO revealed the latest WasteServ statistics on how the island is managing its plastic trash and warned that it is “lagging behind” in reaching national and EU Targets.”</p>

											<p>My fight, my fight is to understand and develop a localised plan to combat waste and turn trash into your golden treasure. Was are now living in the Anthropocene age, and I want us to turn to our man-made materials to repurpose. As Sanne Visser said in the book called Wast-ed ‘in the future, it won't be called waste. Virgin materials will become so rare and precious that it will become normal for waste to be part of production’.</p>
											<p>During my last few 2 years after graduating from my B.A in Spatial Design I have worked in both architectural and fabrication companies. The last thing they thought of in the production line of their “product\space” is the effect of their design on the environment. The one project which inspired me was a collaboration between Matter Make (Malta) and a local NGO Zibel.</p>
											<p>The creation of terrazzo tile was created through recycled plastic collected from the sea clean-ups that Zibel does think the year. Through my fight I want to join and be part of the creative minds who create a closed system loop. To tactical the different solutions to waste in a way to move forward and live in a commodity-free society. I want to create a guide of con-crete methodologies to inspire and help others adapt to new ways of producing. A main aim in this fight and emphases on the changing the word waste into a more perpetual and positive word.</p>
											<p>My fight is to a create a world without trash, a world where the product end cycle is a new raw material for new products which emphases a loop in manmade materials.</p>

We needed to craft a table to understand fully on what we could gain from each of these workshops to maximise our development potential. As you can see in the table and info graphic above one can see the direction I an movinh towards. During one of our sessions we needed to do an exercis such as speed dating. During this exercis we exchanged our skills knowlage and attitudes to each of our class mates. This exercise was done to see what our pers can offer you and what you can offer them to create your hybrid profile. I felt like this exercise was a good way to start making each one of us start comunicated in a way to help one another.  </p>

											<p class="bigger">Though this week’s workshop/seminar we touched on the subject called atlas of weak signals. Weak signals are subjects and topics that are emerging out of the ever changing future. The main weak signal that I choose is Rural Futures. I choose this main weak signal as I feel like it dives into many different topic that I am interested in.</p>
											<p>After this workshop/seminar I realised my fight is a development that I am still trying to figure out. After the exercise with the “card game” I understood that I am interested in more than one subject. From the games and discusses I figured out I would like to develop my idea in a way that is understanding the communities I am in. I am trying to understand what is lacking and what they would want to have a focus on in their communities.</p>
											<p>Through my understand of weak signals I wanted to understand the way we can create a martial loop. I want to understand how each house hold discards there waste. What waste is to them? How to change the mind set of what waste is and what it could be? I want people to understand though my process at Mdef that the end life cycle of one project could be the starting life cycle of another product. I want it to be so rare that new martials are used. I want the “full world” to become less full.</p>
											<p>I have also thought and spoken about with my fellows class mates and friends about capitalism and what is our next utopia. How not acknowledging what capitalism this for the development of our technology. Therefore my question is on how we can develop into the next phase. In one of my conversations in this week my roommate said a bold statement </p>

											<p class="bigger">The experience of looking at the weak signals I am drawn to on a multi scale was hard to see. I took the time to speak and understand what all my weak signals mean and how the relate to one another. On the Saturday after the workshop/seminar I went around the city trying to discover what I would want to do. I did some volunteer work at Connecthort in Poblenou. Seeing the community with a bit more of an open eye I would love to re develop the multi scale approach.</p>
                      <p>During the last session we discussed points with each other. I was discussing between 2 group one called Unlearning to Learn and Solarpunk. The discussion between these  group where very different.</p>
											<p>In the first group Unlearning to Learn, we delved into a conversation and discussion on why we felt like our topic was to educate. I said a statement which resonated with people “ students like me” as I was a student who didn’t thrive from the normal education system. I also felt like my idea of education was very much linked to Audrey. I would love to study and impact the education system to have more of hands on learning with workshops that could educate different generations to understand the impact for farming, marital cycle and more.</p>
											<p>In the second group Solarpunk I felt like the discussion was not like the group before. We all had to create a little mood board in the miro board of why we connected to solar punk. Most of the session was taken up by doing this. So we came to the conclusion that the solarpunk group needed to be split up into 2 smaller groups with more common interests to have a greater discussion. Therefore I am hoping next week will be able to create a time to discuss the context.</p>
											<p>Though this week I have thought about how I would like to conduct some research. I choose to do the multi scale in a way of divided these rings into 2 rems – Malta and Spain/Barcelona. Therefore I would say the people I would like to contact are, the NGO Zibel and Rafel Sammut. Both local business owners that are trying to make a change in the Maltese communities. Zibel is an NGO that do beach clean-up all around Malta they are now moving into a new wave to see how they can turn some of there collected waste into martials. Where as Rafel is a local restaurant owner who grows his own produce and is in change of world food day in Malta. These 2 areas of are 2 that I am very passionate about and would love to understand on what they do a bit more in dept. </p>

											<p>I would love to become part of the Connecthort community and the area of collecting organic waste from different markets around Barcelona. I would love to join and volunteer with the Fablab’s project on Food Shift. I am a home chef that tries to cook a substantial about of vegetables. I want to do a workshop with different age groups, though schools businesses teaching them about how to change there house hold waste into materials.</p>
											<p>I would love to start experimenting in my house whole waste and turning it into different forms of materials. I would like to start documenting the different types of waste I gather in my house and how many times it get though away each week. I would like to weigh the waste and see for just one person what we could do to help the in creating marital loops.</p>
											<p>There are a few amount of skills I would like to add in my development plan. I would love to understand and create my own bio materials. I would want to develop a into my skills in developing and coding as I feel like it is the language of the future. I have a strong belief that coding should be though to all children in schools as it is as important as any other language. Though this I feel that I need to expand on y skill of leaning by doing and experiment more instead of just academic studies. By doing this I will be expanding my prototyping skills and getting to know the materials I am working with.   After this course I would like to become more verst in the topics that are our everyday fights and problems to find a better solution. This will make me more confident with the knowledge I have.</p>

											<p class="bigger">During this week’s workshop I felt a bit overwhelm with knowledge that I had never heard of before. I was excited before starting this workshop as I feel that with was I want to progress on I need to have a good understand on biology and ecology. having the lectures with such brilliant people Nuria and Jonathan made me feel a bit nervous to ask questions if I didn’t understand. So I sat in the front of every class which made me feel better. </p>
											<p>The workshop was structured into two parts a daily four hour presentation and was then followed by hands on work after a break. This whole week was so tiring as we would be grained with information from the first session I was exhorted to focus in the hands on practical work. I would have benefited with more hands on work as from that I remember most of what was said.</p>
											<p>For me the best part of the course was the second half of the day I was very impressed on how we manged to do bacteria experiments which normal house hold products. Understanding that we don’t need a crazy lab to conduct experiments which we can do basic testing with. </p>
											<p>What I learnt from the first half of the days sessions is that biology is such a complex subject. That you should try familiar with it but if you want to do any experiment. You should speak and co create with a scientist as they will have the best knowledge and output on how you want and can achieve your creation. Through this understanding I have found a new respect for biologists and what they do for the world and how their minds and patients alters the world we are living in today. </p>
	<p>The hands on sessions where very exciting to me, for our first experiment we prepared yeast, lactobacillus, and all-purpose media in petri dishes and gathered bacteria samples from our environment to identify if those types of bacteria were present. Where I gathered sample which are: </p>
	<p>Sample 1 – Borka’s Glass Reusable Bottle and My Own Steel Reusable Coffee Cup in a yeast lab method. </p>
	<p>Sample 2  – Egg and White Rice from my Curry Based Lunch Box DIY yeast method. </p>
	<p>Sample 3 – My mouth and My Armpit in the lactobacillus. </p>
	can turn some of there collected waste into martials. Where as Rafel is a local restaurant owner who grows his own produce and is in change of world food day in Malta. These 2 areas of are 2 that I am very passionate about and would love to understand on what they do a bit more in dept. </p>

	<p>The second hands on session we spoke and played with scoby and spirulina. Spirulina I found particularly interesting as its classed at a superfood. The super power is that it contain 70% protein when consumed fresh. In Nuria’s word “ one could survive off a diet with just of spirulina, orange juice, and rice of the rest of their lives”. This session helped me understand on how easy it is to grow this items at home. </p>
	<p>The third hands on session we analysed different products and organisms under a microscope to see the natural formation of the products and organisms. </p>

	<p>During the last session of this week Nuria couldn’t make it so we ended up finishing the class before lunch to go explore the world through iNaturalist. </p>
	<p>The lunch on this day was very special. Jose came up with a excises to share food within the class. Everyone needed to make something that made them feel happy (everyone ended up making something that made them feel at home). I would say it was one special afternoon. </p>

											<p class="bigger">During the second week of this workshop we spoke mainly about agriculture and ecology.  these sessions where more relatable then the ones of the previous weeks, I felt like I understood them more as they were relatable onto our daily life’s. I grew up with helping my mum garden during the weekend. We had to pick out the fruit and herbs that she wanted to use during out meals for that Sunday. </p>
											<p>For me what was so interesting about this topic was the development and how it could possible change. Jonathan’s first lecture was about this topic he spoke about ways of revolutionizing. During the session he introduced us to ROMI. Romi project is an EU funded research project that happened within IAAC. This robot was developed for micro-farms. The team developed an open source robot and data analysing software which can help small scale farms to optimise their harvest and minimise their human labour. This topic was so engaging to me I really understood the topic and want to learn more about robotic in agriculture. I also loved the way Jonathan spoke about a future on where we will have spider bots and we will let the land grow like a food forest.  </p>

<p>During these workshop session we had a morning lecture talking about bees. Beekeeping it some-thing I have been fascinated with for a long time. I remember when I was in junior school we had an outing to see the Maltese honey product during our environment class. Little did I know back then on the important of bees. Through this lecture I learnt on how dyer bees are to our civilisation and we need them to keep on doing what they are doing in higher quantities.  </p>
<p>Bees are very intelligent and organised, from the lectures I learnt it is like they are programmed to know what to do from the minute they come into existence. There are many prosses bees do that are just incredible. One of them is the bee waggle dance, this is where walk in a circle, turns around, then walks the same circle in the opposite direction. They repeats this many times. Sometimes, the bee in-cludes a little waggle as they turning around. The duration of this waggle is thought to indicate the quality of the flower patch they have found. I found this just absolutely remarkable. I also loved on how they knew when to make a new queen bee and how they knew and old queen bees had to fight. All these instincts are what I think of as nature. </p>
<p>The bee population as we know is declining rapidly due to our mostly human factors. Jonathan ex-plain this two us in a very easy way of the declining of bee population due to human impact. He com-pared bees to having children and treating them like how humanity treats bees by feeding them one crop every generation, then killing the mother and taking them to another side of the county. Then give them a new mother and feeding a whole new generation a totally different crop. You’ll end up with bees who are stressed, malnourished and unhealthy. As Jonathan said “Bees on Tour”. </p>

<p> One thing  also broth to our attention was the “Murder Hornet” which is a giant wasp is a new predator that  has come from Asia which now is spreading over Europe and USA, this he said was due to the change in the climate and globalisation. This “Murder Hornet” also known as the Vespa Manda-rinia is effecting the civilisation of the bees by killing them in a gruesome and rapid way. It can kill 30,000 bees in one attack by ripping off their heads. </p>
<p>The Open Source Beehives Project was a project that Jonathan spoke about, he started this project at Valldaura which was a network citizen project to track bee decline. They used senor enhanced beehives and data science to study honey bee colonies in different parts of the world. What I found cool about this project was that they compared that honey collected and found that he honey from Belgium Brussels was way more pollinated then the honey collected in Valldaura. They conclusion of this was that people in cities like flowers and in Brussels they have hug park full of different flowers which then equal to higher pollination rates. </p>
<p>This is the link to the project that was spoken about. - https://iaac.net/project/open-source-beehives-project/</p>
<p>During the second session in this week we did various hands on programs. On the first session of this week we learnt about soil sampling was an exercise that was very interesting to me. I learnt about the various type of soil which one could work with. We needed to analysis the physical properties of clay, loam, sit and sand. I feel like this hands on practice will help me in future task throughout this Masters. </p>

<p>On the second session of this week we learn on how to carry out a PCR test where Nuria got virus-es from a part experiment she had done. This was interesting process to learn but after all the PCR tests I had done in these past two years of Covid. But I feel like I wouldn’t use it in my Master’s Project. </p>

<p>On the third session we did to hands on activities , in the first session we made laurel essential oil. We ripped apart the leave in before filling up the copper distillery. Which then started the process to make the few drops of oil. I stayed next to the distillery to keep filling up the copper bucket with ice to make the prosses go faster. </p>

<p>All in All I thought that these intense 2 weeks were full of information which I see on how I can now start thinking of more dynamic ways on tackling certain topics I wouldn’t see possible to do before. I took away that we are more than capable to do more hands on and proactive step to create a better environment which if done well isn’t difficult. </p>

											<p class="bigger">During this week’s sessions we had two different programs in the first workshop living with our own ideas, we got the challenge of creating a prototype for ourselves.  Our first step was to draw a self-portrait and see what we can produce for our client “ourselves”. </p>
<p> We took 30 mins to find products around the fablab workshop or outside around IAAC. We collectively gathered marital that consisted of transparent acrylic, wooden sticks, rope, coffee waste, a plant holder and wasted papers.  </p>
<p> My idea was to create a portable compost bin. Throughout this year I am trying to understand my waste consumption and how it can be limited to going into a landfill. This is why my Portie-compost come in. </p>
<p> I want a place to understand how much time different organic waste will take to decompose and turn into compost and though my product I can test this out. I create a transparent acrylic window to see how this organic waste is getting on with its decomposition and from that I could write notes and analyse it. The sticks on the top are showing the date and type of organic waste that is decomposing.</p>
<p> The fact that I made this product portable give me the opportunity to collect waste from different areas in my life. This was I also like to create a conversation with people to educate and also to be educated. This is creating awareness around the communities I would be going around in. </p>

<p> We then discussed it In the group of our design studio we reflected with each other to understand on how our magic machines can connect to each other’s. During the discuss with Angella Markey she suggested that once combining our machines we could make a physical space where anything could happen. A space where technical understanding is switched to a social understanding. </p>
<p> From this program I reflected that the machine you created might not the first thought you had and it will keep on changing and evolving such as our design prosses should. </p>

  <p class="bigger">Living With My Own Waste</p>
<p> During this session I emersed myself into my waste for 24hs. On Thursday 4th November I collected all the waste I was going to though into the bin. By doing this I tapped the waste it to my body and I understanded on what I want consuming and throwing away. Through this year I want to understand what people throw away in there house hold. When tackling domestic waste one can reuse more of the items that are throw away. Though my fight I want to create an understanding on how our domestic waste can be reused into new product life. I want to understand how much plastic is consumed in a household. </p>
<p> During this investigation I created a time line on what I was doing and how I was feeling; and this is what I discovered. </p>
<a class="popup-vimeo" href="https://vimeo.com/645553684"></a>
<p> 8am – Made breakfast: 1 egg and 1 slice of cheese (waste: egg shell – organic waste, Egg Box – Cardboard and Cheese Box – Plastic) I am motivated and ready to see the outcome. </p>
<p> 9am – Made tea: 1 teaspoon of cane sugar, 1 black tea bag, 3 drops of oat milk ( waste: Tea Bag - organic waste) </p>
<p> 11.30am – Went for a small food shop for my lunch – (recipe left behind) </p>
<p> 12pm – Went to grab a coffee at my local coffee shop, walking there I got a lot of looks and giggles which made me feel very uncomfortable I felt as though I was 13 years old going through puberty and developing self-consciousness. Until I got a great reaction from the barista saying it’s the weirdest thing he has ever seen and that its awesome. I took my coffee ground waste and added it to my waste of the day. I was shown to Borka’s facetime meeting and they all laughed and said It was a crazy cool idea. (coffee ground waste - organic waste) </p>
<p> 9am-12pm – I have been posting my journey on social media to get reactions from people which is great. These post are making me feel better then walking in the streets which is crazy to me as social media is making me feel more comfortable. This might be because I am explaining my prosses. </p>
<p> Maybe I should speak to strangers on the street that look at me and get their reactions rather than an observation, to try and understand this topic and see what they do to reduce their waste? </p>
<p> 1.30pm – headed home to make my lunch and clean the house. On the way home I facetime some of my family. My sister was at work and showed me to some of her college and they started to comment on how much waste they where using. </p>
<p> 2pm – Made lunch: 5 potatoes, 1 egg, 1 tomato can, 1 jar of chickpeas, raisins, rice, 2 garlics and a eggplant (waste: egg shell – organic waste, potatoes peels – organic waste, garlic peels – organic waste Rice – Organic Waste, Can – Metal and a Jar –Glass) </p>
<p> 2.30pm – Cleaned and Washed the apartment, which was a challenge. </p>
<p> 3pm – Class meeting. Seeing all the class motivated me to keep on going. </p>
<p> 3.30pm – Eat Lunch. Which was not digesting well.</p>
<p> 4.30pm – Reflected on the day so far and took a small uncomfortable nap. </p>
<p> 5.10pm – Tutor call. Which motivated me after feeling all the un comforts of the waste on me.    </p>
<p> 5.30pm – Reflected on the call. </p>
<p> 6pm – Went to meet my father after 2 months. I was nervous for this as I didn’t know what he would tell me but it went down well and he was very curious about what I was doing. </p>
<p> 7pm – Walked down Passeig De Gracia  to the La Rambla. While walking my bottle kept on falling off so I had to stop at every red light to fix it. </p>
<p> 8pm – Went to a restaurant and collected food waste. (waste: lemon – Organic Waste, Coffee Ground Waste - Organic Waste) while being at the restaurant I felt uncomfortable at first and then I got some funny reaction from the staff which made the whole night better as they joked around with me.  </p>
<p> 11pm – Got home (was sick most of the night and weekend) took off waste from my belly. </p>
<p> 8am next day – Took of the remaining waste. Took off leg waste, was feeling very sick. </p>
<p> During this investigation I wanted to develop an understanding on the waste that is thrown into the landfills. I felt as though my body was walking trash, there were new noises, smells, constraints and observations. I felt the uncomfortable feeling of our beautiful plant once we throw the waste into landfills. I never thought that for one that wearing myself consumed trash would feel this way. </p>
<p> I would like to do this investigation a few times over the year to understand the decrees in my waste consumption. I want to understand what we can do with our self-produced waste. I would like to completely eliminate sending products to a landfill and find a new life cycle for these products. It has also made me more aware on what we shop and how we shop. I would like to reduce my plastic waste and consumption. </p>
<p> I would like to investigate how long product that are in domestic homes take to degrade. I would like to study of waste in household especially in organic waste and plastic waste. As I found it inevitable that plastic is going to be used at least once per day. I would like to understand how and why aren’t we using old materials and if so could we possibly have a new bin just for products to be reused again. </p>
<p> After this investigation and exploration, I feel that though our shared experiences on these videos we all got a better understand about the world around us. Using different skills to explore communicate and stepping out of our comfort zone to practice what we believe in. I wished that I joined some of the other group during this time but I was too focused on my own project which made me not interact or collaborate with others. I would love to do this excurse again and fully engage with others topics. </p>

<p> During the first week of beyond the myth, we had two programs that was immersed into four days. During the first program we learnt to investigate products by un-engineering them. We split up into five different group. In my group we did a forensic investigation on a inductive hob. During this investigation we tried to understand why the hob was not working anymore as it was relatively new and looked in a good condition. Therefore we dissected it to see if any components were working, then we tried powering the user interface circuit board, which was not working. We got some components to turn on with the DC Power Supple: the exhaust fan and the LED lights which did work individual. I reflect back now where I would have try to power the Power and control circuit board without the interface circuit board before we ripped it apart to see if power was flowing through as the fuse was still intact. </p>

<p> After the five group presented there forensic investigation I understood that most physical technologies are similar. Although all the products where different they had common elements such as Power and control circuit board which was present in the Princess Induction hob and the iRobot Roomba. </p>

<p> The other three items which were presented where an Imac 2006, Apple Powerbook and Hitachi TV. These three items are similar in screen system, Hitachi TV is the newest product of the three it was interesting to see on how the way things worked are similar but they have developed since the two Apple products. </p>

<p> In the Hitachi TV the display is working through a lightbox which is being powered by led lights which is similar to both the Imac 2006, Apple Powerbook. In the Apple Powerbook there was an interesting feature of the keyboard it included fibre optic cable to light up the keys which in nowadays we use led strips. </p>

<p> I also learnt during the Hitachi TV presentation on how many countries where part of the construction of the TV. Where the packaging only says made in Japan. Which makes you question all the product you own where do they truly come from. </p>

<p> To conclude I found this exercise super impactful I never knew how easy and also how complex physical technology was. I enjoyed learning about a whole new world by physically dis assembling products. This is a literal definitions of learning by doing. </p>

<p class="bigger">Measuring the world </p>

<p> During the second half of the week we did a workshop about data collection and on how to present the data you have collected. We first touched upon the topic of big tech companies and having a right to the product you buy, having  a right to fixing your product etc. We also analysed the methodologies on the process of empowerment to co-creating to change making to openness. </p>

<p> Which then got us onto the topic of our data collection. Where we had four points of how to go about it 1 ask yourself things you want to know, create a hypothesis, where you then capture the data through one tool which you had to come up with an argument on how the other tools should use they others tools so you get the one you want, once the data is collected you will need to analyses it and figure out if your hypothesis is true or false. </p>

<p> In my team we started to discuss the topic of safety in Barcelona, which then went into the safety in IAAC of the people that make up IAAC (student, Faculty and Visitors). We discussed the topic of non-binary people and there pronouns which lead to the question of “are people aware of different pronouns?”. This was investigated as during the induction week we were never asked or got told what are the lectures or the students pronouns. This made us think if the people around us there aware. We then came up with two more questions to analyse which were: </p>
1 “ how often do people ask you your gender pronouns?” </p>
2 “ how often do you ask people their gender pronouns?” </p>

<p> We collected the data through a physical form. We created a board out of Jablo as the base, with a cardboard frame, which was covered in brown paper. We designed a 3D board for getting the people’s answers. With a skewer stick each person participating chose the location (question 1, question 2) and then pierced the wood in the board (question 3). </p>

<p> We left this board with the instructions of use in the bathroom of IAAC. The time that we spend collecting data was between Thursday 3:30 pm to Friday 10:30 am. During this time frame we got 54 participants. </p>
<p> We did have some feedback and some process we couldn’t analyse because of the way we conducted the research. 1 was that the rules for answering questions where not clear for everyone (language and simplicity), 2 the bathroom is a safe space but we don´t see interaction and 3 if we have too much answers the analogue tabulation of data will take too long as we make all the process manually. </p>
<p> The Data cleaning and normalisation was done on google sheets. Where the normalisation of the data was used in the stage of analysing. We used python jupyter notebook to analyse and create visual representations of our data output. The representation in jupyter where separately where each question was answered, then comparing outputs of different questions to show the co relations. Where in x – y relation the output was linear relationship means that whenever others ask us about our gender pronouns, we are also more proactive and ask people their pronouns, y – z relation the output was more people who are OFTEN (0.4-0.6) asking about gender pronouns, then those who consider themselves aware about gender pronouns and x – z was similar. </p>

<p class="bigger"> During this week’s session we had the workshop call the almost useful machine. I gathered that the program is done so that we break down the steps of technology. Though this program I understood that we can narrow down the tech to understand on how a basic instruction works to eventually understand how most technology works in the same way. </p>
<p> From Tuesday to Friday we needed to as a team to come up with a concept create and make sure it works to be presenting on the Friday. It was a long week where we all stayed at school till around 8pm everyday to get the project done and to make sure it works. </p>

<p> In my team we were over ambitus which I loved we all were experts in the assigned roles that we took but we made it work. We all collectively designed the machine ‘A3P2’ which was a useful machine that shows the emotion of vulnerability. </p>

<b> The Fab Haiku </b>

<p> Edging on the inside and outside, </p>
<p> In an instant</p>
<p> you'll see the real me. </p>

<b> The Concept </b>

<p> Our machine represents the feeling of vulnerability. </p>
<p> When you look at it, it looks strong, with spikes out. </p>
<p> When you get closer and tell it a secret, you can discover who the machine really is. </p>

<p> We then had to create the machine from the products that we dismantled in the Forensics of the <p> Obsolescence workshop.  The aim of this week’s workshop was to create good time management, <p> spiral development, Iterative design process, ‘multiple forms from the same idea’ and execute. </p>
<p> We needed to maximise the uselessness to become useful, minimise key words create a visually <p> attractive machine and integrate design elements into it. </p>

<b> The martials we used</b>

<p> Led light</p>
<p> Servo motor</p>
<p> Glossy paper from LCD screen</p>
<p> Fiber optics from the mac keyboard</p>
<p> Electronics kit with ESP32 board</p>
<p> Microphone</p>
<p> Plywood for the base and guide</p>
<p> Acrylic for the mechanics</p>
<p> Smartfil Glace</p>

<b> Structure & Design Team </b>
<p> 3D design the global machine</p>
<p> 3D design the top dome</p>
<p> 3D print the dome</p>
<p> Laser cut the structure</p>
<p> Create a pattern for the pieces that surround the machine</p>


<b> Coding Team</b>
<p> Prepare the code logic</p>
<p> Program the microphone and motor separately</p>
<p> Program the whole system</p>

<b> Mechanics</b>
<p> Create a plan for the up and down movement</p>
<p> 2D design gears and support pieces</p>
<p> Laser cut the gears</p>

<p> We got the machine to fully function and managed to create the design we all envisioned. Which looks like a futuristic machine that is coming from star wars which was not our intention. We wanting the function to be that when you speak to the machine it will light up and pull the fiber optics into the machine, after a minute the fiber optics will come out and the light will switch off. We used the scraps from a TV screen to make it a bit more sci-fi and translucent as a function when the light goes one can see how the mechanics are working on the inside. </p>

<p> On the first day of this workshop we checked if all the mechanics are working such as microphone motor and light. We discussed what the concept will be of the machine and the came up with a design. </p>

<p> On the second day we draw up all the part of the design to fabricate the machine as we had a 3D printed head which would have taken around 16h to print so we needed to get this out fast. I designed and modelled this dome and sent it to be printed we had some difficulties as it was at firsts taking 21h to print which wouldn’t have made us be on time but we manged to get it down to a 16h print. There for it would have been ready the next morning. During this time my team members were working on the coding logic and making the code work for each of the items. We were also preparing the laser cutting files for the body and the mechanics. </p>

<p> On the third day we went straight into fabrication and constructing it took us around 4 tried to get the laser cutting prefect and stable for the motor to not drop all the times but it works in the end. We assembled all the items together with the hot glue gun. On this day we stayed at school till closing to make sure it was prefect. </p>

<p> On the last day we had to film, we where five teams in all and had only a few hours to film each machine in the way each team wanted it to be filmed. This meant that we needed to know exactly how we wanted to present A3P2. The problem of this day was that the cameras battery was dead by the time my team got to use it. So we had one take and one take only. This for us was very frustrating as all the teams before us had lots more time to organise there shoots and take different angles and so on. So after the day ended my self and Paula stayed on to try and shott exactly what we wanted with my phone which turned out to be great. </p>

<p> On the whole I felt like this workshop help me understand how important the way that you design and integrate technology. I would like to design more with people how have a better understanding in emerging technologies. </p>

											<p class="bigger">Just because we can't get out and about like we normally would, doesn’t mean we have to stop taking pictures. There’s still plenty you can do, provided you're prepared to use some imagination. Here are a few ideas to keep you shooting until normal life resumes.</p>
											<p>Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable things about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so we can remember them when it is all over.</p>
											<p>Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the sense of historical pictures from before the invention of the motorcar. Other things that are different at the moment will be queues to get into stores and the lines marked out on the floor to show how far apart we should be.</p>

											<b>Roles Of Prototyping</b>
											<p class="bigger">Reflecting on the roles of prototyping I've used.</p>
						   				<p>Prototype 1 – Though this first prototyping I want to understand the role 1 of prototyping. In role 1 of prototyping I am experimenting with DIY Bio Martials for the first time. Throughout this week I have collected a few items to evaluate on how long they take to decompose. </p>
											<p>I have collected coffee waste form 3 different places in Barcelona.</p>
											<p>1.	My home throughout the week my roommates and I collected the coffee waste in a jar with paper towels to soke up moisture.</p>
											<p>2.	Syra Coffee which I was given a large cup.</p>
											<p>3.	Nomad Coffee which I was given there whole waste bag at the end of the day.</p>

												</div>
												<p>In my experiments I have create a number of different prototypes with different ingredients. Which entail egg shells, dried taco soft shells,  potato peels, coffee from 3 different places, agar agar and glycerol.
During these prototypes I wanted to understand 2 main stages. I wanted to understand how different recipes can change the way the material can turn out. I wanted to see on how different thicknesses can effect they texture of the material. After these materials are created I wanted to study the rate it takes for them to composed.

											<p>Cooked in the over at 180 degrees 10 mins on each side</p>
											<p>To conclude in this recipe I put to much to much ingrediencies and not enough binding components. The material came out not binding together which made it fall apart. There for in the next few test I change some of the components in the mixture. </p>

<b> Design Studio 3 </b></div>
<b> Communication</b>
<p> During this session of design studio we got a lector from Kate. During this session she spoke about documentation beyond presentation. Documenting it for your design prosses which needs to be what you are, a mees on one day or flowing on another. We tried to understand what was missing from our own visualisation skills. Kate did this but us putting up our hands to see how we feel and where were thing we can improve. I left that consistency, style and communication was missing form my own documentation. We also went into the exploration on how to bring light into what went wrong with the process of documentation and what wasn’t there in my documentation. I need to discovery who I am and how I want to represent myself as a designers. I need to push my boundaries to see what I am capable of . By doing this I can create connection with people who can contribute to my design space. Though my documentation I can create a story on how I got to where I am for more people to understand the process and create a similar design ethic. </p>
<p> During this session we did two exercise the first one was about documenting the space you where in. We first had to go to a space alone. Kate prepared 10 audio notes to help us documenting better. We all had to listen to the first and last audio and then had to choose anything from the second till the ninth to focus on.  </p>
<p> Suring the first listen I just processes on what she was saying I sat calmly on the roof of IAAC taking in the space. This made me understand what I needed to prosses. Then I processed to the documentation of the space. This is where I walked around and tried to explore by searching feeling looking touching and smelling. </p>
<p> I then focused onto the light audio, I have a strong feeling and emotion towards light, I created this connection for a young age as I find light a source of greater power and greater being which sounds so magnificent to me. On this day the natural light was strong warm from the sun, it illuminated the space, the ground, the walls, the people the object and me. The  shadows are casted by the 1m wall that’s is around the building, where the shadow set it was cold and dark. These different areas had different tones and feelings that when you sit in the different areas of the space. The area that was unseen was the gutter it was dark and humid this is were the rain water is collected. </p>
<p> The feeling I gathered in this is space was relaxing, it was a space away from noise and obstruction. Light gives me different emotions and can make you feel different emotion, that’s why in meditation spaces the light is an important factor in the space as it can change the connection with how you feel. </p>
<p> During this excurses I dropped my bottle in the floor which created a loud noise and effected the space and the people in it. I rolled on the ground on feel and understand the space a bit better I wanted to feel the shadow and the sunlight in my skin. I have come back to this space every day this week and I fell more and more in love with it. This space feels like a safe haven away from all the chaos. </p>
<p> This exercise was done to show us that we see spaces from different lenses and we all see the world in a different way and document the world in a different way. This is part of our arsenal, to create your own boundaries, critically understanding how to use them. </p>
<p> Documentation feeds Communication. This idea is a good way on how to think about documentation. Communicating is for informing, targeting, curating, critique and storytelling. </p>
<p> In the second exercise we had to do a documentation for another perspective in your body so other can see how or what you feel. I am the shortest person in the class so I wanted them to observe what and how i feel always looking up at people. My point of view must be different from other people. I interviewed Marina with a few questions as I found it really difficult as my face was completely covered. So I couldn’t see what I was feeling or where I was directing the camera at all. </p>

											<p class="bigger">Just because we can't get out and about like we normally would, doesn’t mean we have to stop taking pictures. There’s still plenty you can do, provided you're prepared to use some imagination. Here are a few ideas to keep you shooting until normal life resumes.</p>
											<p>Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable things about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so we can remember them when it is all over.</p>
											<p>Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the sense of historical pictures from before the invention of the motorcar.

													<p> How Do I Document? </p>
<p> My documentation process is mostly writing and taking photos and videos. I post most of my work and process on social media for people to comment and I can take in a count of what they say. I do tend to draw from time to time but I would like this form of documentation to flow much more. I feel as though that the only documentation I was doing in the past few months was writing down my prosses and reflecting on that, while taking photos and videos of that prosses. </p>
<p> I am initially writing all my thoughts on a note pad which I then re-read and transfer onto an online platform. This way I gather the information I received again and I can filter what I find important to me and what I don’t want to focus much on. </p>
<p> How Would I like To Document? </p>
<p> My documentation skills I feel need to be more creative I needed to get back into sketching and visualising my documentation. This way I can create my mind map plan and products not only though description but also though creation. I would like to visualise my thought process and understand on hoe I would want to product my work in videos sketches and  audio. I would like to create some podcast and create an analogy discussing with experts and in that way create a documentation of our work together. </p>
<p> I would like to join some challenge on visualisation such as the 1 drawing pre day for 365 days. This would make me feel more comfortable and confident with my drawing skills.  </p>

	<p class="bigger">Summary </p>
	<p>This article in divided into eight part each area analysing the topic different from introduction to what they had concluded. By 2025 there will be 1/3 tons of plastic in the ocean in comparison to fish. With this information we know that FFP (fossil fuel derived plastics) invades different species of marine life. This is effecting gas exchange, food chains, ecosystems, everyday health and more. In one of the statements  an analyses suggest that more syntactic materials that were found in marine life were produced before the 1970’s. Therefore suggesting that the material took 50 years to reach there current state. It is evident that plastic is found in polar extreme locations from mountain tops to the most remote depths of the oceans. Plastic pollution is not only the fragments itself but “FFPs contain dyes, flame retardants and plasticizers, some of which are persistent, bio-accumulative toxins”. </p>

	<p>The price of plastic is a main topic throughout as they speak about as they specify that it “requires us to shift the economics of FFPs from a linear to a circular mode” to combat the plastic pollution.  It takes into count the failures of the manufacturing and disposal process, these both have a significate impact on the ecosystem and out health. Where at least 10% of the 60% plastic waste that is dumped into landfills ends up into our oceans. The oceans capacity to regulate earth’s climate is reducing each year though plastic waste. The plastic management model is more “burn, bury, befoul” instead of the 3 R’s. </p>

	<p>The understand of the implications of plastic pollution in human health is still enumerated, where plastic can be in contact with our cells though the interaction of nano-plastics and also though the contamination of plastic in our food packaging, house hold products and more which one can digest inhale and have skin contact where 74,000 micro plastics are ingested by humans each year. Though this research one can see that baby and infants  are the highest at risk due to the baby food packages, toys and even breast milk. </p>

	<p>What will the principles be to the solution of this crises where a realistic solution would be “converting plastic waste into a cashable commodity”. Though this a great amount of considerable funds will be generated by the contributor by tackling plastic issues creating a circular plastic economy. Global scale commercialising has failed in recycling most used plastic into high-purity polymers though emerging technologies due to  stubborn market price. Evening out the playing field could be done by higher the cost if FFP’s which potentially lead plastic producers to seek lower cost feedstocks. Creating cashable commodities though incentivising recovery and recycling rates by demanding for recycled polymers.
This step forward will both develop and developing markets contribute in this circular economy of recycling businesses. </p>

	</div>
	<p>Implementation of the contribution will be done the concentrated point in the supply chain. By “facilitates the application of the Contribution on a simple, equitable and transparent per-weight basis, streamlining stakeholder participation and industry-wide application.” Which would only create a small price increase to the end consumer by contribution passes though the base of the supple chain. </p>

	<p>Though this the governance of the Contribution will be done to insure that no fraud and corruption. Though different organisation one can come to a responsible governance agreement. With this agreement one can follow four constitutional pillars will be prioritised. Which are to drive the global deployment and technologies, providing pollution remediation, recovery of plastics in the oceanics and any other environmental policies which mitigate climate change. </p>

	<p>If the plastic industry doesn’t act then the contribution will have to step up and force similar initiative
with international treaties to the four constitutional pillars. Governments are administering taxes and
regulations on goods, as trillions of plastic items are traded globally daily. Transcending the issues of
national taxes, laws and treaties is the contribution global solution. </p>

	<p>The quantum required an economic model which required different regions to collect waste to
capitalise the market incentive and the plastic demand of elasticity price. </p>


	<p>Contributing solutions to plastic pollutions is helping the damage done to our societies, economy and
natural environments. The approach in far broader economic and technical will catalyse the change
that needs to be made to replace plastic with other materials. Circular economies should get onto the
wagon of creating circular economy by transforming placing waste into cashable commodities. </p>

	<p class="bigger">Reasons of Interest</p>

	<p>Plastic pollution is a crises that we can see in the highest and lowest parts of our plant. We can see it
with and without our naked eye. During the last few years this pollution is becoming more and more
evident. I have been scuba diving for half my life in different areas of the world and for me seeing plastic
in the ocean was nothing new.  I recon I have seen more plastic then exotic fish in the ocean, I have
sailed in the Mediterranean sea and have seen up to 4 turtles floating dead due to eating or choking on
plastic. </p>

	<p>These last few years I have participated in beach and bay clean ups, were every year we tackle all the same locations and not so surprisingly the same amount of waste we clean is gathered each year, just keeping the bay partially clean for the summer season. I have also started to carry plastic bags when I go to the bay to clean up waste I see once I head home, we do this with scuba diving too. </p>

	<p>Though this I am expressing that plastic pollution is everywhere once we understand on how to tackle the situation more the less we will see. </p>

<p>These three marine algae’s are found in our oceans across the world. Brown Algae (Phaeophyta) is a type of prevalent seaweed. This type of algae is found is different type of climates. This type of algae has “holdfasts” which are root-like structures which attach the algae to a surface.  This type of algae grows only in saltwater and mainly on a rocky coastline. This algae contains “vitamins and minerals including vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, vitamin E, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, iodine, calcium, magnesium, iron, sodium, phosphorus, as well as small amounts of zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium.”  </p>

<p>The red algae has over 6000 species of its kind, the colour of this algae comes from the pigment phycoerythrin. It has the ability live in the deepest part of the ocean to intake blue light.  </p>

<p>The green algae can be found in both fresh, seawater and even moist soils. There are 3 forms of this algae in which collectively have over 4000 species that exist on the planet. The forms are unicellular, colonial, or multicellular. </p>
<p>(Kennedy, 2019) </p>

<p class="bigger">Ideonella sakaiensis </p>
<p>Ideonella sakaiensis is a bacterial strain that is capable of breaking down and consuming the plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as a sole carbon and energy source. </p>

<p>In this I-Gem Article paper they explain structure of I. sakaiensis and how it breaks down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) Plastic. </p>

<p>In 2018 an I-Gem Article was relisted by a team in Yale University explaining the prosses of how Ideonella sakaiensis breaks down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which is a polymer. This type of plastic is mainly used in synthetic fibres to water bottles.  This is done by breaking PET into two organic Monomers which are ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA). The problem in this paper they are trying to fix is the time frame that the PET breaks down in I. Sakaiensis much fast then it naturally one does. </p>

<p>In this figure below it is showing how PETase and MHETase, work together to degrade PET. The twpo steps are MHET, yielding TPA and ethylene glycol. </p>

<p class="bigger">Method: </p>

<p> 1. Understand the structure of Ideonella sakaiensis and the different algae I would like to use. </p>
<p> 2. Place into a dish and sanitise the space. </p>
<p> 3. Extract the genes of PETase and MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis . </p>
<p> 4. Place the different algae in different incubators to have a sanitary space.    </p>
<p> 5. Inject the genes of PETase and MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis  by using crispr cas9 into the different type of algae. </p>
<p> 6. Added sanitised PET plastic into the incubator on the algae. </p>
<p> 7. Analyse the prosses on the PET plastic degrading through the algae. </p>

	</ul>
</div>
<p class="bigger">Reflection  </p>

<p> Through this task I understood and learnt about the capabilities of crispr cas9. The ethics behind it and the way that it can be used in both bad and good. But through these techniques if used in a correct and in an ethical way we could save the plant from our self-made disasters. The understanding of my creative project I would still question the ethics of using crispr cas9 to modify the way the algae works. I would like to still believe that by adding new genes it does not eliminate the good processes of algae. </p>
