											<p class="bigger">During the Mdef Bootcamp, we had to think, understand and acknowledge what we want to learn during our intense 9 months at Mdef. What is my fight? A fight according to the Cambridge Dictionary stands for “ is to use a lot of effort to defeat or achieve something, or to stop something happening:” Therefore to understand what my fight was I needed to see what I would like to put my energy and effort towards.</p>
											<p>Coming from a spatial design background - a densely populated island - always allowed myself to view the island relations to the destruction or control money and investment as in the changes in our surrounding environment.</p>
											<p>I saw the changes of consumerist culture throughout my childhood and today I ask the same questions of the lack of care and time being put into the materials we use, discard and create with Growing up on a small island that has a lot of potential I have found myself wondering how greed and money controlled our environment. I grew up from having my essentials out of glass bottles where at the end of the week we took them outside our doorstep to be collected and reused. To transform into having everything transported in plastic. At a young age, I asked myself and my elders why this was happening and why they didn’t seem to care that much.</p>
											<p>Here I am somewhat 15 years later asking myself the same question.</p>
											<div class="quotebox">
												<div class="icon">
													<img class="svg" src="img/svg/quote.svg" alt="" />
												</div>
												<p>“Only one per cent of Malta’s plastic waste was recycled in 2019, with most ending up dumped in landfill, according to a new report published by the National Audit Office. The NAO revealed the latest WasteServ statistics on how the island is managing its plastic trash and warned that it is “lagging behind” in reaching national and EU Targets.”</p>

											<p>My fight, my fight is to understand and develop a localised plan to combat waste and turn trash into your golden treasure. Was are now living in the Anthropocene age, and I want us to turn to our man-made materials to repurpose. As Sanne Visser said in the book called Wast-ed ‘in the future, it won't be called waste. Virgin materials will become so rare and precious that it will become normal for waste to be part of production’.</p>
											<p>During my last few 2 years after graduating from my B.A in Spatial Design I have worked in both architectural and fabrication companies. The last thing they thought of in the production line of their “product\space” is the effect of their design on the environment. The one project which inspired me was a collaboration between Matter Make (Malta) and a local NGO Zibel.</p>
											<p>The creation of terrazzo tile was created through recycled plastic collected from the sea clean-ups that Zibel does think the year. Through my fight I want to join and be part of the creative minds who create a closed system loop. To tactical the different solutions to waste in a way to move forward and live in a commodity-free society. I want to create a guide of con-crete methodologies to inspire and help others adapt to new ways of producing. A main aim in this fight and emphases on the changing the word waste into a more perpetual and positive word.</p>
											<p>My fight is to a create a world without trash, a world where the product end cycle is a new raw material for new products which emphases a loop in manmade materials.</p>

We needed to craft a table to understand fully on what we could gain from each of these workshops to maximise our development potential. As you can see in the table and info graphic above one can see the direction I an movinh towards. During one of our sessions we needed to do an exercis such as speed dating. During this exercis we exchanged our skills knowlage and attitudes to each of our class mates. This exercise was done to see what our pers can offer you and what you can offer them to create your hybrid profile. I felt like this exercise was a good way to start making each one of us start comunicated in a way to help one another.  </p>

											<p class="bigger">Though this week’s workshop/seminar we touched on the subject called atlas of weak signals. Weak signals are subjects and topics that are emerging out of the ever changing future. The main weak signal that I choose is Rural Futures. I choose this main weak signal as I feel like it dives into many different topic that I am interested in.</p>
											<p>After this workshop/seminar I realised my fight is a development that I am still trying to figure out. After the exercise with the “card game” I understood that I am interested in more than one subject. From the games and discusses I figured out I would like to develop my idea in a way that is understanding the communities I am in. I am trying to understand what is lacking and what they would want to have a focus on in their communities.</p>
											<p>Through my understand of weak signals I wanted to understand the way we can create a martial loop. I want to understand how each house hold discards there waste. What waste is to them? How to change the mind set of what waste is and what it could be? I want people to understand though my process at Mdef that the end life cycle of one project could be the starting life cycle of another product. I want it to be so rare that new martials are used. I want the “full world” to become less full.</p>
											<p>I have also thought and spoken about with my fellows class mates and friends about capitalism and what is our next utopia. How not acknowledging what capitalism this for the development of our technology. Therefore my question is on how we can develop into the next phase. In one of my conversations in this week my roommate said a bold statement </p>

												<b>So what does this statement really mean?</b>

											<p class="bigger">The experience of looking at the weak signals I am drawn to on a multi scale was hard to see. I took the time to speak and understand what all my weak signals mean and how the relate to one another. On the Saturday after the workshop/seminar I went around the city trying to discover what I would want to do. I did some volunteer work at Connecthort in Poblenou. Seeing the community with a bit more of an open eye I would love to re develop the multi scale approach.</p>
                      <p>During the last session we discussed points with each other. I was discussing between 2 group one called Unlearning to Learn and Solarpunk. The discussion between these  group where very different.</p>
											<p>In the first group Unlearning to Learn, we delved into a conversation and discussion on why we felt like our topic was to educate. I said a statement which resonated with people “ students like me” as I was a student who didn’t thrive from the normal education system. I also felt like my idea of education was very much linked to Audrey. I would love to study and impact the education system to have more of hands on learning with workshops that could educate different generations to understand the impact for farming, marital cycle and more.</p>
											<p>In the second group Solarpunk I felt like the discussion was not like the group before. We all had to create a little mood board in the miro board of why we connected to solar punk. Most of the session was taken up by doing this. So we came to the conclusion that the solarpunk group needed to be split up into 2 smaller groups with more common interests to have a greater discussion. Therefore I am hoping next week will be able to create a time to discuss the context.</p>
											<p>Though this week I have thought about how I would like to conduct some research. I choose to do the multi scale in a way of divided these rings into 2 rems – Malta and Spain/Barcelona. Therefore I would say the people I would like to contact are, the NGO Zibel and Rafel Sammut. Both local business owners that are trying to make a change in the Maltese communities. Zibel is an NGO that do beach clean-up all around Malta they are now moving into a new wave to see how they can turn some of there collected waste into martials. Where as Rafel is a local restaurant owner who grows his own produce and is in change of world food day in Malta. These 2 areas of are 2 that I am very passionate about and would love to understand on what they do a bit more in dept. </p>

											<p>I would love to become part of the Connecthort community and the area of collecting organic waste from different markets around Barcelona. I would love to join and volunteer with the Fablab’s project on Food Shift. I am a home chef that tries to cook a substantial about of vegetables. I want to do a workshop with different age groups, though schools businesses teaching them about how to change there house hold waste into materials.</p>
											<p>I would love to start experimenting in my house whole waste and turning it into different forms of materials. I would like to start documenting the different types of waste I gather in my house and how many times it get though away each week. I would like to weigh the waste and see for just one person what we could do to help the in creating marital loops.</p>
											<p>There are a few amount of skills I would like to add in my development plan. I would love to understand and create my own bio materials. I would want to develop a into my skills in developing and coding as I feel like it is the language of the future. I have a strong belief that coding should be though to all children in schools as it is as important as any other language. Though this I feel that I need to expand on y skill of leaning by doing and experiment more instead of just academic studies. By doing this I will be expanding my prototyping skills and getting to know the materials I am working with.   After this course I would like to become more verst in the topics that are our everyday fights and problems to find a better solution. This will make me more confident with the knowledge I have.</p>

											<p class="bigger">In today’s workshop living with our own ideas, we got the challenge of creating a prototype for ourselves.  Our first step was to draw a self-portrait and see what we can produce for our client “ourselves”.
We took 30 mins to find products around the workshop outside and also had a small coffee then we started. I got some transparent acrylic, wooden sticks, rope, coffee waste, a plant holder and wasted papers.
</p>
											<p>My idea was to create a portable compost bin. Throughout this year I am trying to understand my waste consumption and how it can be limited to going into a landfill. This is why my portie-compost come in.
I want a place to understand how much time different organic waste will take to decompose and turn into compost and though my product I can test this out. I create a transparent acrylic window to see how this organic waste is getting on with its decomposition and from that I could write notes and analyse it. The sticks on the top are showing the date and type of organic waste that is decomposing.
</p>
											<p>The fact that I made this product portable give me the opportunity to collect waste from different areas in my life. This was I also like to create a conversation with people to educate and also to be educated. This is creating awareness around the communities I would be going around in. </p>

											<p>Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and then you will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where one edge meets another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when the light is on or off.</p>

                      <p class="bigger">Living With My Own Waste</p>
											<p> What did you make? And why did it matter? </p>
                      <p> I emersed myself into my waste for 24hs. On Thursday 4th November I collected all the waste I was going to though into the bin. By doing this I tapped the waste it to my body and I understanded on what I want consuming and throwing away. Through this year I want to understand what people throw away in there house hold. When tackling domestic waste one can reuse more of the items that are throw away. Though my fight I want to create an understanding on how our domestic waste can be reused into new product life. I want to understand how much plastic is consumed in a household. </p>
                      <p> What happens when you involve yourself? </p>
                      <p> During this investigation I created a time like on what I was doing and how I was feeling this is what I discovered. </p>
                      <p> 8am – Made breakfast: 1 egg and 1 slice of cheese (waste: egg shell – organic waste, Egg Box – Cardboard and Cheese Box – Plastic) </p>
                      <p> 9am – Made tea: 1 teaspoon of cane sugar, 1 black tea bag, 3 drops of oat milk ( waste: Tea Bag - organic waste) </p>
                      <p> 11.30am – Went for a small food shop for my lunch – (recipe left behind) </p>
                      <p> 12pm – Went to grab a coffee at my local coffee shop, walking there I got a lot of looks and giggles which made me feel very uncomfortable I felt as though I was 13 years old going through puberty and developing self-consciousness. Until I got a great reaction from the barista saying it’s the weirdest thing he has ever seen and that its awesome. I took my coffee ground waste and added it to my waste of the day. I was shown to Borka’s facetime meeting and they all laughed and said It was a crazy cool idea. (coffee ground waste - organic waste) </p>
                      <p> 9am-12pm – I have been posting my journey on social media to get reactions from people which is great. These post are making me feel better then walking in the streets which is crazy to me as social media is making me feel more comfortable. This might be because I am explaining my prosses. </p>
											<p> 1.30pm – headed home to make my lunch and clean the house. On the way home I facetime some of my family. My sister was at work and showed me to some of her college and they started to comment on how much waste they where using. </p>
                      <p> 2pm – Made lunch: 5 potatoes, 1 egg, 1 tomato can, 1 jar of chickpeas, raisins, rice, 2 garlics and a eggplant (waste: egg shell – organic waste, potatoes peels – organic waste, garlic peels – organic waste Rice – Organic Waste, Can – Metal and a Jar –Glass) </p>
                      <p> 2.30pm – Cleaned and Washed the apartment, which was a challenge. </p>
                      <p> 3pm – Class meeting. </p>
                      <p> 3.30pm – Eat Lunch. </p>
                      <p> 4.30pm – Reflected on the day so far and took a small uncomfortable nap. </p>
                      <p> 5.10pm – Tutor call.  </p>
                      <p> 5.30pm – Reflected on the call. </p>
<p> 6pm – Went to meet my father after 2 months. </p>
<p> 7pm – Walked down Passeig De Gracia  to the La Rambla. </p>
<p> 8pm – Went to a restaurant and collected food waste. (waste: lemon – Organic Waste, Coffee Ground Waste - Organic Waste) </p>
<p> 11pm – Got home (was sick most of the night and weekend) </p>
<p> 8am next day – Took of the remaining rubbish. </p>
<p> What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? </p>
<p> During this investigation I wanted to develop an understanding on the waste that is thrown into the landfills. I felt as though my body was walking trash, there were new noises, smells, constraints and observations. I felt the uncomfortable feeling of our beautiful plant once we throw the waste into landfills. I never thought that for one that wearing myself consumed trash would feel this way. </p>
<p> Did anything change about your way of working? </p>
<p> I would like to do this investigation a few times over the year to understand the decrees in my waste consumption. I want to understand what we can do with our self-produced waste. I would like to completely eliminate sending products to a landfill and find a new life cycle for these products. It has also made me more aware on what we shop and how we shop. I would like to reduce my plastic waste and consumption. </p>
What does it mean for your future work? </p>
I would like to investigate how long product that are in domestic homes take to degrade. I would like to study of waste in household especially in organic waste and plastic waste. As I found it inevitable that plastic is going to be used at least once per day. I would like to understand how and why aren’t we using old materials and if so could we possibly have a new bin just for products to be reused again. </p>
After seeing the videos of your collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? </p>
After this investigation and exploration, I feel that though our shared experiences on these videos we all got a better understand about the world around us. Using different skills to explore communicate and stepping out of our comfort zone to practice what we believe in. I wished that I joined some of the other group during this time but I was too focused on my own project which made me not interact or collaborate with others. I would love to do this excurse again and fully engage with others topics. </p>

											<b>Roles Of Prototyping</b>
											<p class="bigger">Reflecting on the roles of prototyping I've used.</p>
						   				<p>Prototype 1 – Though this first prototyping I want to understand the role 1 of prototyping. In role 1 of prototyping I am experimenting with DIY Bio Martials for the first time. Throughout this week I have collected a few items to evaluate on how long they take to decompose. </p>
											<p>I have collected coffee waste form 3 different places in Barcelona.</p>
											<p>1.	My home throughout the week my roommates and I collected the coffee waste in a jar with paper towels to soke up moisture.</p>
											<p>2.	Syra Coffee which I was given a large cup.</p>
											<p>3.	Nomad Coffee which I was given there whole waste bag at the end of the day.</p>

												</div>
												<p>In my experiments I have create a number of different prototypes with different ingredients. Which entail egg shells, dried taco soft shells,  potato peels, coffee from 3 different places, agar agar and glycerol.
During these prototypes I wanted to understand 2 main stages. I wanted to understand how different recipes can change the way the material can turn out. I wanted to see on how different thicknesses can effect they texture of the material. After these materials are created I wanted to study the rate it takes for them to composed.

											<p>1/2 a handful of agar agar</p>
											<p>3 table spoons of oat milk and water </p>
											<p>3 table spoons of at home coffee waste </p>
											<p>Cooked in the over at 180 degrees 10 mins on each side</p>
											<p>To conclude in this recipe I put to much to much ingrediencies and not enough binding components. The material came out not binding together which made it fall apart. There for in the next few test I change some of the components in the mixture. </p>

											<p>To conclude in this recipe I over cooked the material in the over and it dried up and cracked. The material came out full of cracks and peeled off the silicone tray . There for in the next few I was consistently checking in the material to see if its over drying. </p>
